# CNN-for-Image-Classification

## Dog vs Cat Classifier using CNN

This project demonstrates how to build and train a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** using TensorFlow's Keras API to classify images of dogs and cats.  

## Overview
- **Training Dataset**: 4000 images of dogs, 4000 images of cats.
- **Test Dataset**: 1000 images of dogs, 1000 images of cats (used for evaluation).
- **Prediction**: The trained model can classify images from the `single_prediction` folder as either a dog or a cat.

## Requirements
- **TensorFlow**: Keras is integrated within TensorFlow, providing an intuitive API for building and training deep learning models.
- TensorFlow's backend supports efficient computation and distributed training, simplifying the process of creating complex neural networks.

## Usage
1. Train the CNN model on the provided dataset.
2. Test the model's accuracy using the test dataset.
3. Use the model to classify new images in the `single_prediction` folder.
